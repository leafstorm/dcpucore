========
dcpucore is an embeddable DCPU-16 emulator and assembler for Python.
There are existing DCPU interpreters for Python, but basically all of them
are designed to run completely standalone.

(The goal is similar to `dcoy`_, an earlier project of mine, but my lack of 
familiarity with the C ecosystem resulted in that one never going anywhere
practical. However, it was a good learning experience both for C and for
processor emulation in general.)

dcpucore is written for Python 2.7. If Python 3 compatibility is desired,
it will be added later.
